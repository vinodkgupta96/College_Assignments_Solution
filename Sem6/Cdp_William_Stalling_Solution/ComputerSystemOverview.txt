1.1
Four main elements of computer
A.Control Unit :: Which interprets the instructions in memory.
B.ALU :: Which does the binary operations.	
C.Main Memory :: Which stores the data and instructions.
D.I/O :: Input/Ouptut equipment and respective operations are managed by Control Unit.

1.2
Two main Categories of processor registers.
1.User visible register :: Enables the machine-assembly level programmer to minimize main memory references by optimizing register use.  
2.Control and status registers :: Control the operations of CPU and by previledged operating system routine to control the execution of various programs.

1.4
An interrupt is mechanism by which an I/O device or memory may interrupt the sequencing of processor.
1.5
Either disable the next interrupt until previous is handled successfully or use priority based interrupt handler.
1.6
cost,access time and capacity.
1.7
chache is small and faster memory.It works between CPU and main memory.Cache acts as a buffer for least recently used memory locations.
1.8
multiprocessor system:It has multiple CPU seperated in a machine on different chip.
multicore system: It has multiple cores on same chip.
